# LINEAR-REGRESSION-MODEL
This program is a linear [regression model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-linear-regression/), which gathers input and uses machine learning to predict the output. The algorithm provides a linear relationship between an independent and dependent variable. The program was coded with the help of the knowledge-base AI [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), and with the help of a blog from [Medium](https://medium.com/), discussing a similar project.

# Instructions
The program needs certain dependencies to run properly. In my case, I coded and implemented the program on a Windows 11 system.
1. Install [rust rover IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/):
![rustrover](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddc2265b-ecf4-459c-9a7a-ee41e2279adb)

2. Install [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for Windows from the rust website.
![rust](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b40ee5a-faa4-4675-a5cd-06739b7b3b45)

3. Follow the instrutcions to install the required dependencies and for more information and guidelines, you can view [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) online

# The code for the program

![main](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b83bbd0-44c6-49b8-8480-f71302e866ff)

- Ensure that the dependencies are correctly configured within the Cargo.toml file

![cargo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0932eb4d-47cb-4957-a5dd-e638234262b6)

- This is what the output of the code should look like

![rust run](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8df16c65-3f61-46aa-9faa-0f07553e9472)
