# LINEAR-REGRESSION-MODEL
This program is a linear [regression model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-linear-regression/), which gathers input and uses machine learning to predict the output. The algorithm provides a linear relationship between an independent and dependent variable.
# Instructions
The program needs certain dependencies to run properly. In my case, I implemented the program on a Windows 11 system.
1. Install [rust rover IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/):
2. Install [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for Windows from the rust website.
3. Follow the instrutcions to install the required dependencies and for more information and guidelines, you can view [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) online
